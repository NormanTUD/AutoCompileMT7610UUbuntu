# This will try to install everything needed for mt7610u

You can download and modify the script, or, if you trust me, just run:

> wget -O -  | bash
> sudo su -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NormanTUD/AutoCompileMT7610UUbuntu/master/run.sh)" root

This has been tested on Debian 9 and Kubuntu 19.04 (but without the hardware stick; I could only check 
if the Kernel Modules are available and loadable!).
